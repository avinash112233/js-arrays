# Array Exercise 22

Open file **task22.js**. inside it write a JavaScript program to rearrange array elements 
according to the absolute difference with x, i. e., the element having minimum difference 
comes first and so on and return the result.
Note: If two or more elements are at equal distance arrange them in the same sequence as 
in the given array.

Write a JS program. This program contains a function which takes two arguments: an 
array and a number x. This function returns the array according to the requirement.

Sample Input: array=`[10, 5, 3, 9, 2]`, x=7. Expected Output : `[5, 9, 10, 3, 2]`.

**Explanation**:

7 - 10 = 3(abs)

7 - 5 = 2

7 - 3 = 4

7 - 9 = 2(abs)

7 - 2 = 5

So according to the difference with X,
elements are arranged as 5, 9, 10, 3, 2.

Hints:

- Create a function with name and parameters
- Declare local variables and assign values
- Return the result and call the function with arguments
- Assign result in output variable and Return the output variable
